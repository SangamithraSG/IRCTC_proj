# 🚄 IRCTC Real-Time Data Pipeline using Google Cloud (GCP)

## 📢 Overview  
The **IRCTC Real-Time Data Pipeline** is a cloud-based data processing system designed to ingest, transform, and store real-time streaming data from IRCTC (Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation). This project leverages **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** services such as **Pub/Sub, Dataflow (Apache Beam), BigQuery, and Cloud Storage** to enable seamless data processing, transformation, and analysis.

## 📁 Architecture Overview  
### **🔹 Data Flow Pipeline**
1. **Data Ingestion**: Simulated **IRCTC Mock Data** is published to **Google Pub/Sub**.
2. **Data Processing**: A **Dataflow pipeline (Apache Beam)** reads data from Pub/Sub, applies **Python UDFs** for transformation and fault tolerance.
3. **Data Storage**: The transformed data is stored in **Google BigQuery** for analytics.
4. **UDF Registration**: User-defined functions (**transform_UDF.py**) are registered from **Google Cloud Storage** to BigQuery.
